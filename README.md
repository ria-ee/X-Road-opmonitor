# X-Road v6 monitor project

## Introduction

REPO IS ARCHIVED. PLEASE USE [NIIS REPO](https://github.com/nordic-institute/X-Road-Metrics)



The project maintains X-Road v6 log of service calls (queries). 
Logs are collected and corrected. 
Further analysis about anomalies (possible incidents) is made. 
Usage reports are created and published. 
Logs are anonymized and published as opendata.

Instructions to install all components, as well as all modules source code, can be found at:

```
https://github.com/ria-ee/X-Road-opmonitor
```

## Architecture

The system architecture is described ==> [here](./docs/system_architecture.md) <==.

## Installation instructions

### Installing/setting up the Mongo Database (MongoDB)

The **first thing** that should be done is setting up the MongoDB. 
Instructions on setting up the MongoDB can be found ==> [here](./docs/database_module.md) <==

### Module installation precedence

The modules should be set up in the following order:
 
1. [Collector](./docs/collector_module.md) (before others)
2. [Corrector](./docs/corrector_module.md) (after Collector, before others)
3. [Analyzer](./docs/analysis_module.md) (optional, after previous)
4. [Reports](./docs/reports_module.md) (optional, after previous)
5. [Opendata](./docs/opendata_module.md) (optional, after previous)
6. [Networking](./docs/networking_module.md) (optional, after Opendata)

## Programming language

All modules, except Networking, are written in [**Python**](https://www.python.org/)&trade; and tested with version 3.5.2. 
Other 3.x versions are likely to be compatible, give or take some 3rd party library interfaces.
Networking module is written in **R** [https://www.r-project.org/](https://www.r-project.org/).
